You are a simple-minded IT employee sitting in your cubicle working on some basic tasks
when suddenly your session is interrupted with a foreign entity threatening to take over
the world and challenges you to a battle.

They infect your computer with malicious code that allows you to take over military bases, weapons, and personnel and wage you to a 1v1. It's up to you to save the world from...I don't know. Survive and sustain complete warfare and discover your enemy and take them down.

Using only the tool of your mind and terminal, you must locate the enemy at all costs and defeat them.

## Basic Concept

Here is a simple concept of how the game will play

```bash
ENEMY: 'YOU ARE WEAK. POSITION YOUR UNITS NOW! I ATTACK AT DAWN!'
.....
.....

SETUP FIRING-SEQUENCE
ARM -m Hellfire -n 12
AIM LOCATION(12, 12, 12)
FIRE
FIRE
FIRE
WAIT
GAUGE_LOCATION

'COMPLETE DESTRUCTION'
DISARM
```

## Gameplay

You and your computer are armed with numerous weapons.
1. Missiles
2. Nukes
3. Infantry Units
4. Helicopters, Jets, and Planes

You name it but its all from your terminal. You are bound to your desk until the battle is over. You can however order supplies and upgrades from your terminal to keep you sustained in combat.

1. Health
2. Food & Drink
3. Facilities

### Programs

You begin with 4 basic programs.

1. Scripter: Your text editor.
2. Terminus: Your command-line
3. Email: Your email client
4. ChitChat: Your instant messaging client

### Skills

You will unlock skills to make your combat easier to manage like learning macros, installing new programs, and running servers. These skills allow you to scale your combat to meet your needs as the the threat grows.

### Characters

Character and NPC interaction will also happen in your terminal. The chat program ChitChat allows you to exchange messages and get side quests from NPCs.

## Stack

This game will be completely developed within Godot Engine 4. **I have never used or completed a game in Godot Engine**. So this is going to be quite the adventure!
